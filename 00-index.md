### Abstract

Specific cell populations may have unique contributions to schizophrenia, but may be missed in studies of homogenate tissue. Laser capture microdissection followed by RNA-seq (LCM-seq) was used to transcriptomically profile the granule cell layer of the dentate gyrus (DG-GCL) in human hippocampus, and contrast these data to those from bulk hippocampal homogenate tissue. We identified widespread cell type-enriched aging and genetic effects in the DG-GCL that were either absent or directionally discordant in bulk hippocampus data. Of the ~9 million eQTLs identified in the DG-GCL, 15% were not detected in bulk hippocampus, including 15 schizophrenia risk variants. We created transcriptome-wide association study (TWAS) genetic weights from the DG-GCL, which identified many novel schizophrenia-associated genetic signals not found in TWAS from bulk hippocampus, including *GRM3* and *CACNA1C*. These results highlight the improved biological resolution provided by targeted sampling strategies like LCM, and complement homogenate and single nuclei approaches in human brain.
